# XPS Fitting Studio

Web application for XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) peak fitting,
multi-spectrum visualization, and project management. Python/Flask backend
with an lmfit-driven peak-fitting pipeline; single-page frontend in
`templates/index.html`. Deployed at xps.fortierlab.org via a gunicorn
LaunchAgent + Cloudflare Tunnel.

## Stack

- **Backend:** Python/Flask, served by gunicorn. App factory in [app.py](app.py).
- **Fitting engine:** lmfit ≥ 1.3 (5 methods: leastsq, least_squares, nelder, differential_evolution, basinhopping).
- **Numerics:** numpy, scipy.
- **File parsing:** pandas, openpyxl (xlsx), olefile (vgd).
- **Frontend:** Single-page HTML/JS in `templates/index.html` (~8500 LOC). Vanilla JS, no build step.
- **Charting:** Chart.js 4.4 (CDN).
- **Deployment:** macOS LaunchAgent runs gunicorn on **127.0.0.1:5050** (NOT :5000 — macOS AirTunes intercepts :5000 and returns 403, so health-check :5050); Cloudflare Tunnel publishes to xps.fortierlab.org. Dev gunicorn typically runs on :5151 with `--reload` for pre-merge verification. See [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) for the full deploy sequence.

## Project Layout

```

The Flask backend serves the frontend via `render_template('index.html')`
and exposes a REST API consumed by the page through fetch.

## Backend API

Per-upload sessions store parsed `(energy, counts)` arrays as compressed
`.npz` in `uploads/<session_id>.npz`. No server-side memory state —
compatible with multi-worker gunicorn.

## Frontend Architecture

### State

Module-global `state` holds the currently-active tab's working values
(swapped on tab switch by `TabManager.activateTab`):

```js
state = {
  rawBE, rawIntensity,   // full spectrum as loaded
  ccShift,               // charge-correction rigid shift (eV)
  peaks[],               // array of peak objects
  nextId,                // auto-increment peak ID
  chart,                 // Chart.js instance
  residChart,            // Residuals sub-chart instance
  fitResult,             // last fit diagnostics (be, bgIntensity, bgSubtracted, fittedY, chi, etc.)
  lineWidth,             // per-tab line width (sync of tab.lineWidth)
}
```

### Tab model

`TabManager` (a class in `templates/index.html`) holds `tabs[]` and an
`activeId`. Two tab types share the array:

- **Spectrum tab:** has `rawBE`, `rawIntensity`, `peaks`, `fitResult`, `ccShift`, `manualAnchors`, `lineWidth`, `ui` (form field snapshot incl. bg settings, ROI, charge correction method).
- **Stack tab** (`isStack: true`): viewer-only container for references to other spectrum tabs. Has `entries[{id, sourceTabId, color, visible, showFit}]`, `lineWidth`, `verticalOffset`, `_nextColorIdx`. No raw data of its own — entries resolve their source tab at render time.

Lifecycle: `createTab`, `createStackTab`, `activateTab`, `closeTab`,
`_syncActiveToRecord` (writes state-back-to-tab on switch-away). Drag-and-drop
tab reordering exists.

### Peak Object Schema — core fields

(Non-exhaustive. Additional optional fields appear for multiplet linkage, fix-flags per parameter, auto-fit asymmetry bounds, etc. Search the source for `defaultPeak` to see the full shape.)

```js
{
  id, name, color, visible,
  center, fwhm, amplitude,
  shape,       // 'Gaussian'|'Lorentzian'|'Voigt'|'GL'|'asym-GL'|'DS'|'DSG_LA'|'LACX'
  glMix,       // 0–100 (Gauss → Lorentz)
  asymmetry,   // asym-GL asymmetry index
  dsAlpha, dsGamma,                       // DS params
  laAlpha, laBeta, laM,                   // DS+G params (laAlpha=α, laBeta=Lorentzian half-width, laM=Gauss FWHM)
  caAlpha, caBeta, caM,                   // CasaXPS LA params (caM is in DATA POINTS, not eV)
  linked, linkOffset, linkRatio,          // multiplet linkage to parent peak
  isChargeReference,                      // marks this peak as the cc anchor
}
```

### Lineshapes

| ID | Description |
|----|-------------|
| `Gaussian` | Pure Gaussian |
| `Lorentzian` | Pure Lorentzian |
| `Voigt` | Pseudo-Voigt, fixed η = 0.5 on BOTH sides (A03, 2026-09-22: the request sends `gl_ratio: 0.5, fix_gl_ratio: true`; until then the server fitted η FREE from 0.3 while the page drew, integrated and exported 0.5). Use `GL` to fit the mix. |
| `GL` | Pseudo-Voigt with adjustable GL mixing (0–100) |
| `asym-GL` | GL with asymmetric FWHM broadening on high-BE side |
| `DS` | Doniach-Šunjić, `dsAlpha` (0–0.5) + `dsGamma` |
| `DSG_LA` | DS+G — DS asymmetric core convolved with Gaussian. Frontend params `laAlpha`/`laBeta`/`laM`; backend id `ds_g`. |
| `LACX` | True CasaXPS LA(α,β,m) — asymmetric Lorentzian + Gauss conv with a CONTINUOUS m (data points; σ = m/3, half-width ⌈3.5σ⌉) on both sides since the caM unit (2026-09-25). Frontend params `caAlpha`/`caBeta`/`caM`; backend id `la_casaxps`. |

**What the page draws must be what the server fitted.** Two harnesses pin
it: `tests/js/lineshape_roundtrip.test.js` builds the request with the
page's own `peakToBackendSpec`, fits it with `fitting.run_fit`, applies the
result with `_applyBackendParams` and requires `evalPeakArray` on the fitted
grid to equal `individual_peaks[].y` for every shape (it also pins the
Python twin `autofit.reference.peak_to_backend_spec` to the page's builder,
shape by shape); section (D) of `tests/js/lineshape_parity.test.js` sweeps
each shape's FREE parameters across the fit's bounds. Both were added in A03
(2026-09-22) after a "Voigt" was found to be fitted with η free while drawn
at 0.5; the same harnesses then found `p.glMix || 50` / `p.dsAlpha || 0.1`
sending a mix or α of exactly 0 as the default, lmfit clipping a HELD value
to the optimiser's bounds (a DS+G m locked at 0 fitted at 0.05 —
`_make_peak_params._set` now widens a limit to a held value), and the
server clipping DS+G α to 0.495 where the page did not (`_dsgAlpha`). A
held parameter is held at its value; what the page draws is what the
server fitted. No shape carries a tracked gap any more. LACX with m > 0 was
the last (the page drew m rounded to an integer 2m+1 kernel while the
server fits it continuously: up to 0.97 % of amplitude and 1.2 % of area on
the lab's U 4f components) until the `caM` unit, 2026-09-25:
`laTrueCasaXPS_array` now mirrors `_la_casaxps_true` (continuous σ = m/3,
half-width max(1, ⌈3.5σ⌉), `np.convolve` 'same' with the server's trim,
normalisation at the grid point nearest the centre) — ≤ 7e-16 of amplitude
on all 108 committed LA components, pinned across the α/β/m box on seven
grids incl. grids shorter than the kernel
(`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-25-cam-continuous.md`). DS+G was the other gap until 2026-09-22 (the page's quadrature
`laCasaXPS` sized its step to the Lorentzian core, not the Gaussian kernel,
and was wrong by up to 1e52 × amplitude at β = 2, m = 0.05 and 5–21 % low
in area on the very box Find Peaks emits for a graphitic C 1s line);
`dsgConvolved_array` now mirrors the server's padded-grid convolution for
every m — the same FFT circular convolution — pinned at 1e-6 across the
full β/m box on eight grids, irregular grids and centres outside the
window (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-22-dsg-page-evaluator.md`). Two
server limits found there: a DS+G m just above the 0.001 delta threshold
on a coarse grid (m ≤ 0.003 at 0.1 eV, even padded length) underflows the
kernel and returns an all-zero curve — left as is, it reads as a
zero-amplitude component and step (b) flags it; and a centre OUTSIDE the
padded grid was normalised by rounding noise — fixed 2026-09-25 by a NEW
GUARDED BRANCH (normalise by the maximum), proven byte-identical for every
in-range centre against main's function (`scripts/dsg_outside_centre_identity.py`). Details of
A03 in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-22-a03-voigt-eta-identity.md`.

## Design Rules

### Thresholds on data-scaled quantities fail

XPS spans many orders of magnitude within one spectrum, so any absolute
floor, delta or exactness cutoff will misjudge at some dynamic range. Two
units learned this independently — five intensity floors on the Auto-Fit
anchor (answer: a scale-free F test), then two tolerances on that F test
(answer: none). Prefer a scale-free comparison with no tolerance. If a
check seems to need a magnitude threshold, that is evidence the check is
formulated wrong.

(Owner, 2026-09-22. The record: the anchor unit's six Codex rounds in
`docs/autofit/codex/autofit_zero_graphite_*`, the DE unit's tolerance rounds
5–8 in `de_finite_bounds_*`, and the required-refit unit's rounds 2–3 in
`autofit_required_*`. The DE unit is the same rule seen from the other
side: every χ² comparison tolerance produced reachable false failures and
no reachable protection, and the fix was to delete the comparison.)

## Lineshape Physics — Critical Rules

### DS (Doniach-Šunjić) Asymmetric Lineshape

The DS tail MUST always point toward **higher binding energy** (the left
side on a standard inverted BE axis). Asymmetric broadening in metals
arises from low-energy electron-hole pair excitations at the Fermi level,
which produce intensity only on the high-BE side of the core-level peak.

**Never invert the DS tail toward lower binding energy.**

Implementation convention: `dx = center − x`. The power-law term
extends the tail toward higher BE (`x > center` ⇒ `dx < 0`). The
optional exponential cutoff `gamma_asym` decays **only** on that
side — `Math.exp(gamma_asym * Math.min(dx, 0))` in the JS
`doniachSunjic`, equivalent to `exp(−gamma_asym · max(x − center, 0))`
in `fitting.py`'s `_doniach_sunjic`. When adding DS-derived shapes,
preserve this convention: the high-BE side is where `dx < 0` and where
the exponential envelope must decay.

### DS+G (formerly mislabeled "LA(α, β, m) [CasaXPS]")

The shape registered as `ds_g` in the backend (frontend enum `'DSG_LA'`,
dropdown text "DS+G") is a Doniach-Šunjić asymmetric core convolved with
a Gaussian. Despite its old label, this is NOT the CasaXPS LA
formulation. Frontend field names `laAlpha` / `laBeta` / `laM` are kept
for save-state compatibility:

| Parameter | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| α (`laAlpha`) | DS asymmetry index, dimensionless, 0 ≤ α < 0.5 |
| β (`laBeta`) | Lorentzian HALF-width (eV) of the DS core |
| m (`laM`) | Gaussian FWHM (eV) used in the convolution |

Tail points toward **higher** binding energy (DS physics: low-energy
electron-hole pair excitations on the high-BE side only).

Saved fits using the old `'LA'` shape value are auto-migrated on load to
`'DSG_LA'` — math is unchanged, only the label. Saved fits using the
short-lived `'DSG'` shape are auto-migrated to `'DS'` (the shape they
were actually being fit against, due to a pre-existing preview/backend
mismatch).

### LA(α, β, m) [CasaXPS] — true CasaXPS formulation

The shape registered as `la_casaxps` (frontend enum `'LACX'`, dropdown
"LA(α,β,m) [CasaXPS]") implements the genuine CasaXPS LA. Distinct field
names `caAlpha` / `caBeta` / `caM` so users do not confuse them with DS+G's
`laAlpha` / `laBeta` / `laM` (which have totally different units):

| Parameter | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| α (`caAlpha`) | High-BE-side exponent on the unit-amplitude Lorentzian; dimensionless, default 1.0, bounds 0.1–5.0 |
| β (`caBeta`) | Low-BE-side exponent; dimensionless, default 1.0, bounds 0.1–5.0 |
| m (`caM`) | Gaussian convolution kernel width in DATA POINTS (not eV); continuous (the server fits it continuously so its derivative exists; the page draws the same continuous value since 2026-09-25 — it drew an integer kernel; the local engine HOLDS it exactly, since LA's curve jumps at m = 6k/7 and a smooth optimiser cannot fit it), default 50, bounds 0–499 |

α=β=1, m=0 reduces exactly to a pure Lorentzian. Increasing α
**suppresses** the high-BE tail; decreasing α extends it (BE-axis
convention; sign-flipped from CasaXPS's KE-axis description). m controls
Gaussian broadening; effective eV width ≈ (m/3) × dx where dx is the
data step size.

When implementing new LA-related lineshape parameters, **always** add
them to (use grep to find current line numbers — the file evolves):

- `defaultPeak` defaults block in `templates/index.html`
- `syncKeys` array
- `renderShapeControls` LACX param row
- `peakToBackendSpec` LACX branch
- `applyBackendResult` LACX backend-param mapping
- `runFit` JS LM free-params block + per-param clamps + linked-peak sync
- `evalPeak` switch + grid-aware `laTrueCasaXPS_array` evaluator (called via `evalPeakArray`; DS+G's grid-aware twin is `dsgConvolved_array` — a convolved shape's scalar `evalPeak` branch ignores m and must have no caller, parity guard (C))
- `_migrateLineshapeAliases` if backwards-compat alias needed

### UCl4 U 4f Asymmetric Broadening

The asymmetric broadening in the UCl4 U 4f spectrum is due to **5f²
multiplet coupling**, not metallic screening. Do not attribute it to
Kondo screening or Doniach-Šunjić metallic behaviour. Use
multiplet-split component models, not a single DS peak.

When modeling U 4f, use `asym-GL` for the U 4f₇/₂ and 4f₅/₂ main lines,
with separate symmetric GL peaks for the multiplet satellites.

### Satellite Peaks

Satellite peaks (shake-up, shake-off, plasmon loss) use **symmetric**
lineshapes — Voigt or GL. Do not apply DS or LA lineshapes to satellites.

### Linked (Multiplet) Peaks

A linked peak derives its center, amplitude, and **all lineshape
parameters** from its parent. The sync block must cover every shape
parameter — failing to add a new param breaks spin-orbit constraints
during fitting. Search for the `syncKeys` array and the `applyParams`
closure in `runFit` when adding parameters; both need the new key.

| Parent param changes | Linked peak receives |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| `center` | `parent.center + linkOffset` |
| `amplitude` | `parent.amplitude × linkRatio` |
| `fwhm` / `shape` / `glMix` / `asymmetry` / `dsAlpha` / `dsGamma` | same value |
| `laAlpha` / `laBeta` / `laM` (DS+G params) | same value |
| `caAlpha` / `caBeta` / `caM` (CasaXPS LA params) | same value |

## Fitting Algorithm

### Backend (default)

`POST /api/fit` runs lmfit on the server. Selectable methods: `leastsq`
(Levenberg-Marquardt), `least_squares` (Trust-Region), `nelder`,
`differential_evolution`, `basinhopping`. The UI Method dropdown
defaults to **Trust-Region** (`least_squares`); the backend falls back
to **`leastsq`** when a request omits `fit_method`. The endpoint
returns the full result including refined params, σ bounds, χ²,
`bgIntensity`, `bgSubtracted`, and `fittedY`. Linked peaks are
constrained via lmfit parameter expressions.

`differential_evolution` samples from the parameter bounds and refuses an
open one, and the page sends `amplitude_min: 0` with no `amplitude_max`
(a free DS+G centre has no default window either), so until 2026-09-19
every ordinary request for that method returned HTTP 422. For THAT METHOD
ONLY, every candidate (the first search and each perturbed refit) is now
`_search_then_refine`: differential evolution inside a generated box
(`_finite_search_box`: open sides of freely varying parameters only —
amplitude ± max(10 × the largest |background-subtracted intensity|,
2 × |start|, 1), just the ceiling for the page, which sets the floor
itself; centre = the fitted energy range, always a real interval), then —
whenever a side was generated — an UNCONDITIONAL `least_squares`
refinement from that solution under the request's own open bounds. A box
can shape an answer that lies nowhere near its sides, so nothing is
inferred from nearness. A refinement that CONVERGED is the result — a
`least_squares` fit of the requested model under the requested bounds,
which is what the default method returns; its χ² is deliberately not
compared with the boxed search's (a descent cannot end materially above
its start, but it ends a hair above an exact start sitting on a requested
bound, and every tolerance tried for that comparison produced reachable
false failures and no reachable protection — Codex rounds 5–8). If the
refinement did not converge or raised, the search result
stays marked unverified, never displaces a verified candidate in the
perturb loop, and, if it is what `run_fit` returns, is `success: false`
naming the generated limits.
Because differential evolution ignores the start and can "converge" with
a needle-narrow component outside the fitted range, each candidate also
competes with a `least_squares` fit from its own start under the request's
bounds (`_global_or_local_candidate`: verified beats unverified, then the
lower χ² wins), so this method never returns worse than the default method
would from the same start.
Generated sides are never echoed back as `min`/`max` (the page saves
returned bounds and warns within 1 % of them). A returned DE result
therefore normally carries `least_squares` uncertainties and message.
Every other method's parameters are unchanged; `/api/analyze` reaches the
same code through `options.fit_method`. Measured on committed targets with
the page's `n_perturb: 3`: 2–75 s per fit (6–7-component C 1s models
exhaust DE's evaluation budget in every search and are rescued by the
refinement). It is not a gold standard: on one 3-component B 1s target it
returned χ²ᵣ 1.92 where Trust-Region found 1.81.

**Reproducibility (2026-09-21).** Every random draw in `run_fit` — the
`n_perturb` restarts (the page sends 3; ±15 % on every varying parameter)
and the populations of `differential_evolution` and `basinhopping`, which
lmfit otherwise takes from numpy's GLOBAL generator — comes from one seed
that is a pure function of THE NUMBERS THE OPTIMISER IS HANDED
(`_request_seed`: SHA-256 of the energies, counts and the COMPUTED
background curve as little-endian float64, plus the canonical JSON of each
component's lineshape, each lmfit parameter's effective role — a
constrained one is its expression, a fixed one its value, a free one its
value and bounds — the method, solver options and `n_perturb`; tag
`xps-fit-seed-v1`). Settings are hashed by their EFFECT, never as sent, so
nothing the fit ignores can change the draws: a peak's name or colour, the
`fix_gl_ratio` the page still sends for a Gaussian, stale shape parameters
kept after a shape switch, the `endpoint_avg` a linear background does not
use, bounds of a fixed parameter, start values a link overrides, anchor
order, and the peaks' internal ids (parameter names and constraint
references are hashed by component POSITION: the page never reuses an id,
so a model rebuilt after deleting a peak would otherwise fit differently)
(in review each such no-op edit moved an area fraction by 15–45 pp
while the request was hashed as sent). It is a seed,
not an identity (32 bits collide; never a cache key). The response reports
it as `random_seed`; a caller's `fit_kws.fit_kws.seed` (integer in
[0, 2³²)) replaces it and is consumed, never forwarded to a solver.
`run_fit` itself accepts only the five supported methods, case-folded
(`_FIT_METHODS`): `/api/analyze` forwards `options.fit_method` without the
route's allowlist, and lmfit's `ampgo`, `dual_annealing`, … would draw
from the global generator. The seed value and the draws `run_fit` actually
makes (observed through Levenberg-Marquardt) are pinned by tests; numpy does not promise the same `default_rng` stream across
versions, so a failing pin after an upgrade is a release note ("saved
projects regenerate differently"), not something to re-pin silently.

What seeding buys and what it does not. "Identical request" means the same
data, model START values and settings — after a fit the page holds the
fitted values, so a second press is a different request; re-loading a
saved project and pressing Run Fit is the repeatable case. Measured on the
202 committed targets × 5 presses of the identical request, before → after:
Levenberg-Marquardt byte-identical on 145 → 202 targets;
Trust-Region on 51 → 145, area fractions moving by more than 1 pp between
presses on 8 → 0 targets, by more than 0.01 pp on 14 → 2 (worst 0.30 pp,
one U 4f scan where two presses in five land in a neighbouring minimum). Levenberg-Marquardt (MINPACK) and Nelder-Mead are
byte-identical. Trust-Region, the default, is NOT and cannot be made so by
seeding: the BLAS dot product (Apple Accelerate on the i9) rounds one unit
in the last place differently depending on where its argument sits in
memory (`w.dot(w)` gives two values over 16 alignments, `np.sum(w*w)`
one), `norm` inside scipy's `_lsq/trf.py` is the first call to return
different output for identical input, and the iteration amplifies that to
~1e-4 relative in an area at its stopping tolerance of 1e-8. Worse, the
perturbed restarts start from that jittering solution, and near a basin
boundary 1e-5 in a start is enough to send a restart into another minimum:
on the lab's targets that happened once (0.30 pp), but on a synthetic
five-component model two presses of the seeded request differed by 29 pp
(`tests/test_fit_reproducibility.py` docstring). Do not patch scipy
internals for this, and do not tighten the tolerance: ftol = xtol = gtol =
1e-12 on the same 202 × 5 gave FEWER byte-identical targets (123 vs 146)
and made two targets that converge today abort on the evaluation budget.
OWNER DECISION 2026-09-21: ACCEPT AND DISCLOSE; no unit for bit-identity.
Byte-identity is a software property, not a scientific one. The scientific
requirement — reloading a saved project and pressing Run Fit regenerates
the figure within meaningful precision — is met (2 of 202 targets move
more than 0.01 pp, worst 0.30 pp). The 29 pp synthetic case is the SAME
phenomenon as the local-minimum problem (near a basin boundary 1e-4 of
jitter flips the answer), so the scattered-starts cross-check unit is
already the mitigation: it exposes exactly those fits. Do not build a
second thing (a reviewer tried a deterministic perturbation base: identical
starts, results still differed; a reproducible-arithmetic BLAS is a large
project with uncertain payoff). Disclosure wording, for docs and the
student note: identical requests now give identical results on real data
in practice; the underlying arithmetic is not bit-reproducible, so a fit
sitting near a boundary between two solutions can still resolve
differently, and that is precisely the situation the multiple-starts check
is designed to surface.

**Scattered-starts check (step (a) of the 2026-09-21 unit; plan in
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-21-scattered-starts-and-unsupported-components.md`).**
Every Run Fit with ≥ 2 unlinked components sends `n_starts: 3`; after the
normal fit (unchanged: THE FIT is what the student's method returned,
byte-identical with and without the check, and `n_starts` is not part of
the seed) `run_fit` runs three more fits of the SAME method from scattered
starts — drawn from a third stream of the request seed, anchored to the
REQUEST's start (amplitude ×/÷ 3, width ×/÷ 1.5, free centres ± 0.5 eV,
other bounded parameters redrawn inside the middle 90 % of their range),
clamped into the request's bounds (amplitude sign kept). "Same solution" =
every area fraction within 1 pp and every centre within 0.1 eV, COMPONENT
BY COMPONENT by id — no permutations: "C-O" and "C=O" trading places is a
different chemical reading even when both are GL lines. The response's
`starts` reports how many reached
the fit, how many ended in a solution that is NOT better (counted, never
listed — ~25 % of fits have one and listing them would train people to
ignore the panel), and `alternatives`: solutions whose χ²ᵣ is lower by more
than 0.1 %, each with its own areas and every component's centre shift
from the STUDENT'S START. Not run for `differential_evolution` /
`basinhopping`, single-component models, a fit that did not converge,
Batch Fit or the local fallback; a failure inside the check never fails
the fit. Page: one line under the Results table ("2 of 3 scattered starts
reached this solution; …" — counts, never certification language) and,
when alternatives exist, an "Other solutions found" table (your fit first;
the largest move named, amber > 0.5 eV, red > 1 eV) with Preview (the
history-preview overlay, on a copy) and "Use this solution": explicit, one
undo entry, recorded as `fitResult.chosenAlternative`, and ATOMIC by
construction — the alternative is only the START of an ordinary server fit
(`runFit({startPeaks})`); the live model is written by that fit's success
path and by nothing else, so a fit that fails, does not converge, is
discarded on a tab switch or cannot reach the server (no local fallback
here) leaves peaks and result exactly as they were, and σ, exports and
saves come through the one existing path. Every row shows EACH component's
own area % and its own move from the student's start. The evidence is
BOUND TO THE FIT THAT PRODUCED IT by COMPARISON, never by hand
invalidation (so no edit path can be forgotten): `fitResult.startsModelKey`
covers every peak field the request reads (incl. the auto-fit asymmetry
bounds) AND the fit context — background type and window, endpoint
averaging, Shirley iterations, ROI, manual anchors, charge shift — taken
after the result is applied and persisted with the counts.
`_startsIfCurrent(fr, key)` is the single accessor (`_startsLiveKey()` for
the active tab, `_startsRecordKey(t)` for a record): after any such change,
an undo or a history restore that brings back other values, the panel says
the comparison no longer applies, nothing can be previewed or applied, an
open alternative preview is dropped (`_dropStaleAltPreview`), and
saves/exports carry neither counts nor the recorded choice. A name, colour
or visibility is not part of a fit and does not invalidate it. `runFit`
captures the same key before its first await and DISCARDS a result whose
model or context was edited while it ran (the peak controls stay editable
during a fit; a newly locked centre would otherwise keep its edited value
under the server's statistics). The trigger (`n_starts`) is decided with
the other request inputs before the first await. In the RED band — and only there — it first asks,
naming the component and the distance ("This solution moves C-O by
−1.47 eV from where you placed it. Apply?"): a lower χ²ᵣ bought by
relocating a component is the measured trap (8-JT C1s Scan_1/5/6/7), and
the app must never substitute a chemical interpretation because it scored
better. Saves persist the counts (`_startsForSave`), not the alternatives'
parameter sets (regenerable from the seeded request). Measured with the
shipped code on the 202 committed targets: an alternative is shown on 0 of
94 re-fits of a saved solution and 6 of 84 not-yet-fitted starts (7.1 %;
three of them in the red band), median +0.54 s per Run Fit (90th
percentile +1.8 s). It shows that a decomposition is not unique; it cannot
say which one is correct, and four known targets defeat even ten starts.

### Client-side fallback

`runFitLocal` in `templates/index.html` is a JS Levenberg-Marquardt
implementation used as a fallback when the backend is unreachable, and
the ONLY engine Batch Fit uses. Central-difference Jacobian (centre
step scaled by the peak width), active-set step (parameters pushed into a
box wall are held fixed), max 3000 iterations. Terminates on a gradient
cosine < 1e-6, on actual and predicted relative χ² reductions both < 1e-6
in agreement, or on a relative step < 1e-8, and only after a
feasible-descent CERTIFICATE passes: no single free parameter moved by
1e-3 (scaled, inside its box) reduces the residual by more than 1e-6 of
its value, otherwise that point is taken and iteration continues. The
certificate is a coordinate (single-parameter) check, not a proof of a
local minimum along coupled directions; no exit is exempt from it.
Damping exhaustion is a FAILURE. Poisson-weighted since unit W1
(2026-09-18): it minimises Σ(w·r)² with w = 1/√max(raw counts, 1), the
server's weighting, so its statistic is a real χ²ᵣ (objective
`poisson_weighted_chi_square`); results saved by unit A0 were unweighted
and stay labelled "Residual variance". It produces no uncertainties, and it
HOLDS LA's `caM` at its exact value (it used to round it in its clamp; a
free m was tried in the `caM` unit and withdrawn: LA's curve is
discontinuous in m, `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-25-cam-continuous.md`).

**A local result is a STARTING POINT, not a reportable result** (keyed on
`engine: 'local'`, helpers `_isLocalFit` / `_isLocalModel` /
`_localFitCaveat`). Measured in unit W1 and RE-MEASURED after A03
(2026-09-22, `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-22-a03-voigt-eta-identity.md`,
generator `scripts/local_server_gap.js`): weighted, it matches the server on
GL-type models (≤ 4 meV, ≤ 1.4 % area on the lab's C1s scans) and on Voigt
components (fixed η = 0.5 on both sides since A03: on the 5 of 9 committed
U 4f targets where both engines reach the same minimum every component
agrees within 4.3 meV, 2.6 % FWHM, 2.0 % area, 0.12 pp — W1 had measured up
to 20.8 % area on the Voigt satellites); it still differs on the other U 4f
targets for two reasons, separated by a control arm (the server with LA's
m held at the same value): the `caM` hold (the server fits m, the local
engine holds it — on Scan_6 the whole gap), and the local descent stopping
in a worse minimum (5–13 % χ²ᵣ above the held-m server on Scan_4/5/8) —
the "several minima" case (`docs/findings/cam/local_server_gap_after_cam.json`;
both engines' amplitude floor is 0 since unit step (b)). Both engines weight by
√intensity whether the data are counts or CPS (a convention, not a
calibrated uncertainty for rates); the formula is the same but the inputs
are not bit-identical, because `uploadToBackend` rounds intensities to
2 dp before the server weights them. A03 and the `caM` unit are done and
the designation STAYS on both grounds: fitting m locally needs a
derivative-free search (its own unit), and the worse-minimum outcome
(three of nine U 4f targets) remains; the label is reconsidered only on a
re-measurement after that work. (The amplitude-bound change
DECIDED 2026-09-18 — `docs/findings/2026-09-fit-determinacy.md` §3 — is
implemented: unit step (b), 2026-09-22, below.) The same file records that a
converged server fit is not ground truth: on a committed C 1s scan the
server's default method stopped in a local minimum the local engine
avoided.
See `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-18-local-engine-poisson-weighting.md`.

**"Not supported by the data" (unit step (b), 2026-09-22; owner decision
2026-09-18).** A component whose amplitude the fit drove to its floor,
pinned on a bound or fitted to numerical residue is an explicit OUTCOME —
the fit did not determine it — and its centre, width and σ are not reported
as if they were. The statement needs no intensity floor (six were tried for
the Auto-Fit anchor and each rejected real components or accepted residue):
with the other components held at their fitted values, removing this one
must make the fit significantly worse — `fitting._component_support`, the
Auto-Fit anchor's F statistic (F ≥ 10; `SUPPORT_MIN_F`). The SERVER computes
it once per component (`individual_peaks[].support = {f, delta_chi2,
supported}`; a linked component `follows` its parent); the page's twin
`_componentSupportFromResponse` recomputes it from any response carrying
`counts`, `fitted_y` and the component's curve; the LOCAL engine computes
the same statistic from its own residuals and weights
(`_componentSupportCore`), so a component driven to the zero floor by Batch
Fit is an outcome there too. Linked components follow their ROOT ancestor
whatever the request order. The verdict is a property of the fit that
produced it, CONDITIONAL on the other components as fitted, so it is bound
to that fit: `p.support.fitKey` is the model-plus-context key
(`_startsLiveKey()`) taken after the values are applied, and
`_isUnsupported(p)` compares it with the live key at every read — after
the student edits any peak, lock, link, the background, ROI, anchors or
charge correction, or an undo brings back other values, nothing is
suppressed or excluded until a new fit writes a new verdict (a verdict
without a key, from an older save, is never applied; exports write a
Status only from a CURRENT verdict — stale means "not established", never
"supported"). When the key changes, `_refreshStartsEvidence` compares the
set of flagged components with what EACH consumer has rendered — sidebar
badges, Results rows and chart datasets carry the peak id / flag — and
re-renders the ones that differ — the sidebar is PATCHED IN PLACE (header, summary values, area % over the currently supported components, badge), never re-rendered, because the student may be typing in a card (a caller that already redrew the sidebar,
such as Lock All or Add Peak, therefore still gets Results, Quantify and the
chart refreshed); it runs from the lock toggles, Lock All and every
`updatePlot` (which passes `fromPlot` so the chart is not rebuilt from
inside its own rebuild). Auto-Fit locks
every centre and refines the charge shift AFTER the result is applied, so
it re-stamps its verdicts (`_restampSupport`) — those changes are part of
its result. `p.support` is persisted with the peak (saves spread the peak
whole); Batch Fit's copy and a `.fit.json` import set it to `null`
(parameters on other data: nothing established); stack tabs judge a source
component against the SOURCE record's key. Sites
(`_isUnsupported`): sidebar card (badge; centre/width "—"; excluded from the
area total), Results table (greyed row, no centre/width/σ, area kept,
percentage "—", note beneath; percentages over supported components),
uncertainty panel (one rule-0 warning, before the per-parameter alarms and
instead of the neutral "locked" note Auto-Fit's centre lock would produce),
Quantify (no row; listed beneath: "an atomic percentage of 0.0 % would be a
measurement claim"), chart / stack / figure legend labels, no figure label at
the component's (zero) maximum, CSV/XLSX (Status column, empty cells, no
At%, WARNING line — and no width of any kind: DS+G β / m and LA m are widths
too), TSV (column kept, header says so), the scattered-starts table ("Your
fit" row shows neither area % nor a move for it, and it is never the
largest move; an alternative's components are unjudged and shown as they
are). Both engines' amplitude
floor is 0 (`runFitLocal`'s clamp was 1). Measured on the 202 committed
targets: 3 of 752 components (three C 1s re-fits, F 0.95–3.9), 0 of 95 fresh
starts — but committed projects are survivorship-biased (a collapsed
component may have been deleted before saving), so the working-fit rate is
plausibly higher. Known limits, the anchor check's: a gross single-channel
artefact can mark a real component unsupported; REDUNDANCY UNDER OVERLAP is
not detected (a refit without the component is the test; step (c) does it
for the Auto-Fit anchor).

**Acceptance rule for fit outcomes (unit A0, 2026-09-15):** a fit OUTCOME
from Run Fit, Batch Fit or the local engine is shown, stored or exported
only if it converged. `runFitLocal` works on a copy and commits only on
success, returning `{success, iterations, chiReduced}`; `runFit`
treats `success !== true` from `/api/fit` as a failed fit and falls back to
the local engine only on a transport failure, never on a server-side
error. A RESULT IS DISCARDED IF THE MODEL WAS EDITED WHILE THE FIT WAS RUNNING
(2026-09-22; a correctness fix for EVERY Run Fit, shipped with the
scattered-starts check but independent of it). The peak controls stay
editable during a fit. `runFit` captures the model-plus-context key
(`_startsLiveKey()`: every peak field the request reads, background type and
window, endpoint averaging, ROI, anchors, charge shift) beside `peakSpecs`,
before its first await, and after the tab-owner check refuses to apply a
result if that key changed: amber notice, "Fit discarded (model edited)",
previous peaks and result kept. Before this, a centre changed and locked
mid-fit kept its edited value (`applyBackendResult` honours locks) under the
server's χ², σ and fitted curve for a different model.
Not covered by this rule (separate units): model replacement that
keeps an older result (Find Peaks apply in the default window, undo/redo)
and loaded files without convergence provenance. From the initial commit
until this unit the local LM step had the wrong sign and returned the
starting model as "Fit complete"; see
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-15-a01-local-lm-proof.md` and
`scripts/scan_batch_fit_signature.py`, which lists suspected saved files.

## Background Methods

| Backend id | Notes |
|---|---|
| `shirley` | Iterative Shirley (Proctor & Sherwood, *Anal. Chem.* **1982**, 54, 13, 2438–2439). Default. |
| `smart` | Shirley variant with smarter endpoint handling. |
| `smart_exp` | Experimental Shirley variant. |
| `shirley_linear` | Shirley with a linear-fallback bridge. |
| `linear` | Straight line between ROI endpoints. |
| `tougaard` | Single-pass universal cross-section K(T) = B·T/(C+T²)², B = 2866 eV², C = 1643 eV² (Tougaard, *Surf. Interface Anal.* **1988**, 11, 453; kernel max at √(C/3) ≈ 23.4 eV). Order-robust (either BE direction); amplitude anchored to the data at the high-BE edge. JS twin `tougaardBackground` must stay in numerical agreement (pinned by `tests/js/tougaard_twin.test.js`). |
| `manual` (frontend only) | User-placed anchor points; `manualAnchorBackground` in JS. |

Use Shirley for standard core-level regions. Linear only when the
spectral window is very narrow and featureless.

## Quantification

Peak areas are integrated numerically (trapezoidal over BE grid). RSF
(relative sensitivity factor) corrections are applied in the Quantify
tab. Atomic percent = (area/RSF) / Σ(area/RSF) × 100.

---

## Charge Correction

Reference: **C 1s adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV** is the default. The
UI dropdown also offers **C 1s graphitic carbon (sp²) at 284.5 eV** as
an alternative; the Auto-Fit C1s Graphite feature uses 284.5 eV as the
fixed reference for the graphitic component it identifies.

A rigid shift (`state.ccShift`) is applied to all binding energies
before fitting. The corrected axis is produced by `getCorrectedBE()`.

Auto-Fit C1s Graphite derives that shift from the FITTED centre of its
"Graphite" component, so the data must SUPPORT that component
(`_autoFitGraphiteIsSupported`), in the one sense that needs no intensity
threshold: removing it from the fitted model must make the fit to the
server's own data significantly worse. From the `/api/fit` response alone —
`counts`, `fitted_y`, the component's curve `individual_peaks[].y`, the
server's weights 1/max(counts, 1) — F = ((χ²_without − χ²_with)/p) /
(χ²_with/dof), p = the component's free parameters; supported means
χ²_without > χ²_with and F ≥ 10 (or χ²_with = 0). A component driven to
zero, pinned on its bound or fitted to numerical residue has
χ²_without ≤ χ²_with — removing it costs nothing (true of every such
reproduction in `docs/autofit/codex/autofit_zero_graphite_*`); resolved
anchors measured F from 1.7e2 (behind a 300 000-count one-channel spike) to
1e9, and the 70 committed Graphite models F ≥ 1.1e3. Otherwise the auto-fit
is rejected and rolled back with a red notice before any charge-correction
input is touched. Until 2026-09-21 only the centre was checked (±0.3 eV of
284.50), which a zero-amplitude component always satisfies because its
centre is bounded to that window. Do NOT replace this with an intensity
floor: five were tried (relative to the strongest component, the raw span,
the background-subtracted maximum, the raw magnitude, the upload's 0.01
resolution) and each rejected real anchors or accepted residue. The same
statistic is the natural definition for the planned "component not
supported by the data" outcome. Fixtures are real `run_fit` responses:
`scripts/gen_autofit_anchor_fixtures.py` →
`tests/js/fixtures/autofit_anchor.json`. SCOPE: it answers "do the data
support this component?", not "is it graphite?".

KNOWN LIMITS of that check (owner decision 2026-09-21: shipped with them
after six Codex rounds, all NO-GO; do NOT write a seventh rule — six
intensity floors failing is the data saying no threshold on intensity can
mean "zero" independently of the data):
- It REJECTS A REAL ANCHOR when the fitted region carries a gross
  single-channel artefact (a spike of millions of counts, or a dead
  zero-count channel): that channel dominates χ²_with and drags F under 10.
  The user gets a red notice and a rolled-back model; removing the artefact
  or narrowing the ROI recovers. A recoverable refusal beats main's old
  failure mode — a non-existent component silently setting the energy
  reference for a whole spectrum.
- REDUNDANCY UNDER OVERLAP was out of scope for the support check
  (χ²_without holds the other components fixed) and is CLOSED by step (c),
  2026-09-22: Auto-Fit's request carries `require_component: <Graphite id>`
  and the server refits the model WITHOUT that component from the others'
  fitted values under the request's bounds (`fitting._component_required`,
  through the run's own fitter `fit_model` — so differential evolution's
  box/refinement machinery and the request seed apply to the refit too;
  everything linked to the removed component goes with it, transitively;
  every retained parameter is created before any expression is assigned,
  so a chain of links in any request order resolves; NO tolerance of any
  kind on the comparison — a delta floor relative to the data's power and
  then an "exactness" cutoff on the reduced fit each masked a resolved
  anchor at high dynamic range, Codex rounds 2–3, the DE unit's lesson
  again. Known limit, accepted: on NOISE-FREE data whose full fit is exact
  to machine precision F is meaningless and a truly redundant component can
  read "required"; real data never fit to machine precision) and returns
  `required: {required, f, chi2_with, chi2_without_refit, refit_converged}`
  with the same F ≥ 10 rule. `applyAutoFitResult` refuses a supported-but-
  not-required anchor exactly like an unsupported one, before any
  charge-correction input is touched ("refitting the other components
  without it fits the data as well"); the anchor id is captured with the
  other request inputs before the first await. One extra fit, Auto-Fit only; the fit
  itself is unchanged by the check, and a check that did not run never
  blocks. On the 70 committed Graphite models the anchor is required on
  all 70 (F ≥ 54, median 6.1e3 — a measurement with `require_component` over
  the un-committed target file, not a test); the round-6 reproduction (two symmetric GL
  lines, no graphite: support F ~ 1e6 with the others held, refit without it
  equal to rounding) is now refused.
- One rounding-residue construction still passes (unrounded manual
  background a rounding step under data the upload flattened; F ≈ 280).

LOGGED FOR ONE LATER UNIT (untouched): Auto-Fit anchors on a one-channel
spike, and on a featureless plateau under background None, and still
derives a charge correction from it; a rejected Auto-Fit (any reason)
leaves its `pushUndo()` entry and a cleared redo stack behind. The spike
case shares a root with the false rejection above — gross single-channel
artefacts are unhandled generally — so if this becomes a despike /
outlier-flag unit, those three are one piece of work.

Adventitious carbon referencing (284.8 eV) is the default for
convenience but has known criticisms in the XPS literature — the C 1s
position of adventitious carbon depends on surface chemistry and is not
a true universal standard. Graphitic carbon (284.5 eV) or a known
internal reference is preferable when available.

Additional fixed references in the dropdown: Au 4f₇/₂ (83.98 eV), B 1s
for B₂O₃ (192.99 eV), N 1s for BN (398.31 eV), B 1s for BN (190.74 eV),
plus a free-entry "Custom reference" option.

## Multi-Tab + Project Save/Load

The app supports multiple spectrum tabs simultaneously. Project state
saves to `.proj.json` (< 5 tabs) or `.proj.zip` (≥ 5 tabs; manifest +
per-spectrum JSON inside the archive). Schema version 3.

- **Tab IDs** are preserved across save/load. Field is top-level
  `data.activeId`; the saved active tab is re-activated on load.
- **Stack tabs persist.** Saved with `isStack: true` + their entries
  + line-width + offset; spectrum tab data lives elsewhere and is
  reached by `entry.sourceTabId` at render time.
- **Stale stack entry pruning:** if a saved stack references a source
  tab that didn't load, the entry is dropped and an amber toast tells
  the user.

## Spectrum Stacking

A stack tab visualizes multiple spectra on shared axes with per-entry
fit visualization (envelope + shaded peak components, raw-level).
The whole stack chart's behavior is governed by a small set of
invariants worth knowing before touching the code:

- **Dataset keying.** Each entry contributes 2 + 2×N_peaks datasets to
  the chart, each tagged with a stable `_stackKey` of the form
  `<entryId>:raw`, `<entryId>:env`, `<entryId>:peak:<peakId>`,
  `<entryId>:pbg:<peakId>` (the `:pbg` is a transparent fill anchor for
  the matching peak's shaded fill — Chart.js requires a real dataset
  for fill targets). Keys let in-place updates target specific datasets
  without relying on array indices, which shift when datasets reorder.

- **In-place updates preserve zoom.** `_updateStackChart` mutates
  `data` / `hidden` / `borderWidth` / `fill` on existing datasets and
  calls `chart.update('none')`. `_renderStackChart` is the destroy +
  rebuild path, used only on entry add/remove or when the active chart
  is the wrong chart (see next bullet).

- **Chart-type discriminator.** `state.chart._xpsStackTabId` is set on
  every stack chart at creation. `_updateStackChart` rebuilds whenever
  the active chart isn't tagged for the current stack tab — guards
  against in-place updates running against a stale spectrum chart or
  a different stack's chart.

- **3 render-data paths** in `_buildEntryRenderData` cover fresh
  backend fits (Path A: use fitResult.fittedY directly), fresh local-LM
  fits (Path A2: compose envelope from peaks + bgIntensity), and
  post-load reconstruction (Path B: recompute bg from raw via the
  source tab's persisted bg settings using `_computeBackgroundForSource`).
  Render data is cached on the entry as `_renderDataCache` and
  invalidated only at `_renderStackChart` rebuild.

- **Layered visibility model.** Per-entry `entry.showFit` gates whether
  the entry participates in fit visualization at all; the toolbar pills
  (Envelope, Individual Peaks, Fill, Bkgrd Sub) act as global layer
  switches on top. The `peak-fit-control` CSS class hides peak/fit
  toolbar items entirely on stack tabs (Run Fit, Batch Fit, etc.).

## Toolbar Highlights (frontend)

- **Line Width slider** (right panel, always visible): per-tab,
  persisted. Drives raw + per-peak `borderWidth`; envelope uses
  `min(width + 1, 6)` so it stays visually distinct.
- **Vertical Offset slider** (right panel, stack tabs only): vertical
  separation between visible entries.
- **`⇅ Organize Tabs`** (chart toolbar): sorts spectrum tabs as
  Survey → element-alphabetical → Other; stack tabs cluster at the
  end as a block, preserving their relative order.
- **`+ Stack` / `+ Add Spectrum ▾`** (chart toolbar): create a new
  empty stack and add open spectrum tabs to the active stack.
- **Auto-Fit C1s Graphite** (Actions menu): one-click C1s peak model
  + charge correction. Enabled only when the active ROI midpoint is in
  270–315 eV.
- **ROI past the data / centre outside the data** (2026-09-25, warn only):
  `getROIData()` has always clamped an ROI to the data it selects; the page
  now SAYS so under the ROI fields ("ROI extends past your data — clipped
  to X–Y eV" when a field reaches more than one sampling step past the
  data; amber when min > max or the window misses the data) and badges a
  peak card whose centre lies outside the selected data ("outside data").
  Neither the fields nor the peaks are ever moved; the fit, Find Peaks
  (same inclusive mask on the same corrected energies) and saves read the
  ROI exactly as before. `_roiWindowStatus` / `_refreshRoiAndCentreWarnings`,
  refreshed in place from `updatePlot`; plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-25-roi-clamp-and-centre-warning.md`.
- **Manual anchor background**: place anchors on the chart for
  per-spectrum hand-tuned background curves; persisted as
  `tab.manualAnchors`.

## Reference Energies for Common Regions

There is **no demo-spectrum loader** in the app (a `loadDemo(...)`
function does not exist — earlier versions of this file were stale).
Typical regions for hand-testing:

| Region | Window | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Fe 2p | 700–740 eV | Fe(0) at 706.6, Fe(III) at 710.5, satellite at 713.5 |
| U 4f | 370–415 eV | UCl4-like U(IV); 4f₇/₂ at 380.9, 4f₅/₂ at 391.8 (offset 10.9 eV) |
| C 1s | 280–295 eV | sp², sp³, C-O, C=O, COOH components; charge ref at 284.8 eV |

## Known Issues

- Legacy document-level tooltip handlers call `e.target.closest(...)`
  without checking that the event target is an Element
  (`templates/index.html` around the `data-xps-tip` listeners); events
  targeting non-Elements throw `e.target.closest is not a function`.
  Needs an `instanceof Element` guard in a future pass.
- Gunicorn `--reload` watches Python files only — **edits to
  `templates/index.html` are NOT picked up** outside Flask debug mode
  because Jinja caches compiled templates per worker. Restart the dev
  gunicorn after template changes before browser-verifying.

## Development Workflow

- Develop on feature branches off `main`.
- Production gunicorn serves whatever is on disk at
  `templates/index.html`. Browser-verify changes on a separate dev
  gunicorn on **port 5151** (run with `--reload`) before merging.
- Merge to main only after browser verification.
- Design memos and implementation plans live under
  `docs/superpowers/plans/` and are committed alongside the changes
  they describe.
