Review the caM unit: branch fix-cam-continuous, git diff main..HEAD (templates/index.html, tests/js/lineshape_parity.test.js, tests/js/lineshape_roundtrip.test.js, tests/js/local_lm_descent.test.js, tests/js/fit_acceptance.test.js, scripts/lacx_page_vs_server.js, CLAUDE.md, docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-25-cam-continuous.md, docs/findings/cam/). Read-only. Be adversarial. Findings ranked BLOCKER / MAJOR / MINOR with file:line and a concrete failing scenario, then VERDICT: GO or VERDICT: NO-GO. Budget your time: a verdict is required within the run.

CONTEXT (read the plan first). The page drew LA (LACX) with m rounded to an integer 2m+1 kernel while the server (fitting._la_casaxps_true) fits m continuously by design (so its derivative in m exists); the local engine rounded m in its clamp and treated it as discrete (never moved, not a degree of freedom). Contract chosen, as for DS+G on 2026-09-22: the page MIRRORS THE SERVER; nothing on the server changes.

Measured: all 108 committed LA components, page vs server at saved parameters on the tab's ROI grid - before: max 0.97 % of amplitude, area median 0.33 % / max 1.18 %; after: 7.4e-16 and 5.6e-14 % (scripts/lacx_page_vs_server.js; docs/findings/cam/). Re-measurement of the local-vs-server gap (plan §4): the caM half closed; what remains is a different minimum in both directions; the "starting point" label stays (owner's call). JS suite 418 tests, 416 pass, 2 todo (scalar evaluators of the two convolved shapes, by design). Browser: LA drawn vs fitted 1.1e-13 (was 5.6e-3), Results area equal to the server curve's (was -0.66 %), Batch Fit moves m.

TRY TO BREAK
a. The mirror, line by line against fitting.py _la_casaxps_true: the clamps (fwhm, alpha, beta, m incl. NaN / undefined m on the page vs float(None) on the server), the m < 1e-3 branch (the server returns amplitude*base WITHOUT normalisation), half = max(1, ceil(3.5 sigma)) at sigma values where 3.5 sigma is an exact integer (floating-point ceil differences between JS and numpy), the kernel normalisation, the 'same' + trim index formula for every (N, K) incl. N = 1, 2, K > N, even N, the argmin tie rule (np.argmin: first), the peak_val <= 0 fallback (server uses max, not max |.|), a descending grid, a non-uniform grid (the server convolves in index space regardless of spacing - does the page?).
b. Every LA path on the page: chart, _peakArea (Results, sidebar, Quantify, exports), figure export, stack tabs, the Find Peaks candidate preview, Batch Fit, the local engine's Jacobian in m (finite difference across the ceil(3.5 sigma) quantization steps - any kink that stalls or fails the certificate? the m clamp at 0 and 499), linked LA children (m synced).
c. The local engine change: removing the discrete treatment - the certificate, the sensitivity test, dof and the per-component support p now include m; could an LA fit that converged before now fail (a SENS_MIN failure, a certificate loop, a damping-exhaustion failure) - try the committed U 4f Batch Fit targets; is the dof change correct when m is locked by default (fixCaM true)?
d. Saved projects: an LA saved with a fractional m now draws differently on load (0.33 % median area) - is that stated honestly (release note §6)? Any path that rounds caM on load/save/import (fromJSON, .fit.json import, Find Peaks mapping, _migrateLineshapeAliases)?
e. The m input at 2 dp: typing, a value like 8.199345 shown as 8.2 - does editing another field round the model's m (updatePeakParam on re-render)? The model key (_STARTS_MODEL_FIELDS) and the support fitKey after a fit: does display rounding ever write back?
f. Tests: are the new hard assertions real (not vacuous), do the LA grid sweeps exercise K > N, and is the replaced local test's dof check robust (chi could be ~0 on noise-free data)?
g. Docs vs code vs the committed measurement files (every number in plan §2/§4/§6, CLAUDE.md).

Finish with VERDICT: GO or VERDICT: NO-GO.

I’ll read the plan first, then check the diff against the server and probe the mirror, local-fit behavior, and test coverage. I’ll keep this read-only and finish with ranked findings and a verdict.

# The `caM` unit — LA's m continuous on the page and in the local engine (2026-09-25)

Branch `fix-cam-continuous` off main `3ea3b8b`. Queued by the owner after
A03 and the fail-open sweep ("Then the caM clamp"). The record defined the
unit as two halves (A03 plan §5/§6; CLAUDE.md): the page draws LA with m
ROUNDED to an integer 2m+1 kernel while the server fits m continuously, and
the local engine rounds m in its clamp and carries it at its start.

## 1. Contract

The server's continuous m is deliberate (`_la_casaxps_true`: "m flows
through continuously so lmfit's finite-difference Jacobian in m is
non-singular" — rounding made the function locally constant in m and
poisoned the covariance of every other parameter). So, as for DS+G
(2026-09-22), the PAGE MIRRORS THE SERVER; nothing on the server changes.

## 2. Measured before (`scripts/lacx_page_vs_server.js`)

All 108 LA components in the seven committed projects, at their saved
parameters on their tab's ROI grid (106 carry a fractional, server-fitted
m; 107 are unlocked):

| | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| max page − server, of amplitude | median 0.29 %, max 0.97 % | max 7.4e-16 |
| area, page vs server | median 0.33 %, max 1.18 % | max 5.6e-14 % |

`docs/findings/cam/lacx_page_vs_server_{before,after}.json`. The "before"
column is also what a student sees change on opening a saved U 4f project:
the page's LA areas move by 0.33 % at the median, 1.2 % at most, to the
curve the server actually fitted.

## 4. The re-measurement (`scripts/local_server_gap.js` → `docs/findings/cam/local_server_gap_after_cam.json`)

W1's 18 targets, local engine vs server from the same scaled start.

| U 4f target | local χ²ᵣ vs server, A03 | after this unit | max Δarea, A03 → after |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Scan_0, 2, 3, 7 (same minimum) | −0.2 to +0.5 % | +0.1 to +0.8 % | ≤ 1.74 % → ≤ 0.34 % |
| Scan_1 | +1.3 % | +1.6 % | 1.95 % → 1.57 % |
| Scan_4 | +9.6 % | +4.9 % | 8.32 % → 4.30 % |
| Scan_5 | +10.1 % | +9.2 % | 6.65 % → 5.25 % |
| Scan_6 | −5.0 % | −5.7 % | 8.88 % → 11.25 % |
| Scan_8 | +12.7 % | +13.0 % | 8.31 % → 7.91 % |

C 1s unchanged (8 of 9 within 3.8 meV / 0.5 % / 1.4 % / 0.32 pp; Scan_4 is
findings §2). On the four U 4f targets where both engines reach the same
minimum every component now agrees within 3.0 meV, 0.49 % FWHM, 0.34 %
area, 0.02 pp.

Reading: the `caM` half of the gap is closed — on Scan_6, the one target
A03's control arm attributed to the clamp, the local engine now MOVES m and
lands 5.7 % BELOW the server (the server, m free, stops in a worse
minimum; with m held it reaches 2.629, the local 2.639). Everything left is
a different minimum, in BOTH directions: the local engine above the server
on Scan_4/5/8 (+4.9 to +13 %), below it on Scan_6. That is the
worse-minimum finding A03 recorded, not a model difference.

**The "starting point" label.** The owner's condition was a re-measurement
after the `caM` clamp and the worse-minimum work. The first is done; the
second is not, and three of nine U 4f targets still land in a worse local
minimum. Recommendation: the label STAYS; its wording now names only
"several minima" and the absent uncertainties. Owner's call.

## 5. Verification

- `tests/js/lineshape_parity.test.js`: (A) LACX m > 0 and (D) LACX m > 0
  (fractional m, the 1e-3 threshold, 499) are hard assertions; new (D‴)
  sweeps the LA box on six more grids incl. 9- and 2-point grids (kernel
  longer than the grid). `tests/js/lineshape_roundtrip.test.js`: no shape
  has a known gap; LA m locked at 499 and at a fractional 8.66 round-trip
  with the curve compared. `tests/js/local_lm_descent.test.js`: the
  W1-round-1 test pinning "held caM is not a dof" replaced by one pinning
  continuous recovery of m (8.66 from 5), a locked m unmoved, and one more
  dof when free. JS suite: 418 tests, 416 pass, 2 todo (the scalar
  evaluators of the two convolved shapes, by design).
- Browser check (`browser_check_cam.py`, dev :5151): committed
  UCl4-graphite U4f Scan loads with m 8.2 shown as "8.2"; Run Fit → LA
  drawn vs fitted 1.1e-13 of amplitude (was 5.6e-3), Results area equal to
  the server curve's (was −0.66 %); Batch Fit onto U4f Scan_1 converges and
  moves m (6.49 → 7.66); no page errors.
- Python suite: recorded below.

## 6. Release-note line

LA(α, β, m) components are now drawn, integrated and exported with the same
continuous m the server fits (the page rounded it to a whole number of
points): opening a saved U 4f project moves an LA component's area by
0.33 % at the median and 1.2 % at most, to the curve that was actually
fitted. Batch Fit now fits m instead of holding it. m is shown to 0.01.

// Lineshape parity harness — the invariant that was missing until the
// 2026-08-30 asym-GL/LACX bug (see docs/autofit/codex/asym_gl_mismatch_*).
//
// Two DISTINCT invariants, both silently unchecked before this file:
//
//   (A) FRONTEND vs BACKEND: for every shape, the frontend's array evaluator
//       (evalPeakArray, called for chart data build paths) must numerically
//       match fitting.py's registered shape function (_SHAPE_FUNCS) over a
//       realistic BE grid and parameter sweep, including m>0 for the two
//       Gaussian-convolved shapes (DSG_LA, LACX). This is what asym-GL failed
//       — the frontend chart and the backend fit disagreed by ~10% of peak
//       height on real U 4f data.
//
//   (B) FRONTEND vs FRONTEND: the two JS evaluators for a single point,
//       evalPeak(x, p) and evalPeakArray(...)[i] at the same x, must agree
//       with each other. This is a SEPARATE bug class from (A) — even a
//       frontend that's perfectly correct vs. the backend can still disagree
//       with itself if it has two code paths computing "the same" curve.
//       This is exactly what the LACX per-point fallback did: evalPeak()
//       silently ignores Gaussian convolution (m) while evalPeakArray()
//       applies it correctly, so any evalPeak() caller — export/save/Results
//       panel — showed a materially different number than the chart.
//
// NOTE on (B)'s exact formulation: convolution is a GRID operation (it needs
// neighboring points to define a kernel), so it is not well-posed to ask for
// "the convolved value at an isolated point" via evalPeakArray([x], p)[0] —
// with only one point in the array, laTrueCasaXPS_array's own peak-finding +
// renormalization logic collapses to a degenerate constant (amplitude,
// trivially, for ANY x/alpha/beta) regardless of what evalPeak() does. That
// isn't a meaningful comparison for any shape, correct or not. Instead (B)
// asserts evalPeak(x, p) against evalPeakArray(realisticGrid, p)[indexOfX] —
// same real grid the chart/export code actually uses — which is the
// meaningful version of "do the two evaluators agree."

The diff is confined to the page, tests, and measurement records. The convolution indexing looks consistent with the server’s “same, then trim” behavior. I’m now probing kernel-width boundaries and whether adding m to the local Jacobian creates convergence failures.

    True CasaXPS LA(α, β, m) lineshape.

    Built in two steps per the CasaXPS LA manual:

    1.  Asymmetric base Lorentzian. Start with a unit-amplitude Lorentzian
        of FWHM `fwhm` centered at `center`:
            L(x) = 1 / (1 + 4·((x − center)/fwhm)²)
        Apply piecewise exponents to introduce asymmetry. CasaXPS defines
        these on a kinetic-energy axis. We use a binding-energy axis, so
        the sides flip:
            LA_base(x) = L(x)^α   for x ≥ center  (high-BE side)
            LA_base(x) = L(x)^β   for x <  center  (low-BE side)
        Increasing α relative to β SUPPRESSES the high-BE tail; decreasing
        α extends it.

    2.  Gaussian convolution with a continuous-m kernel: σ_pts = m/3,
        kernel half-width max(1, ceil(3.5·σ_pts)) (±3.5σ; see the inline
        comment for why 3.5, not 3), truncation-renormalized, convolved
        with mode='same' on the uniform x grid. m < 1e-3 means no
        convolution. NOTE this deliberately deviates from the original
        integer 2m+1 design (still implemented by the frontend's
        laTrueCasaXPS_array — a tracked ~0.15%-at-m=50 parity gap, todo
        in tests/js/lineshape_parity.test.js): m flows through
        continuously so lmfit's finite-difference Jacobian in m is
        non-singular.

    With α=β=1 and m=0, this reduces exactly to amplitude × L(x) (a pure
    Lorentzian of peak height = amplitude, FWHM = `fwhm`).

    Parameters

    {"shape": "<key in fitting._SHAPE_FUNCS>", "params": {...}, "x": [...]}
or a JSON list of such specs.
Writes a JSON array of y-values (or a list of arrays) to stdout.

Calls fitting.py's OWN registered shape functions (_SHAPE_FUNCS) directly —
never a reimplementation — so the JS parity test is always comparing against
whatever the backend actually ships, with no fixture staleness risk.

All nine committed U 4f Batch Fit targets converge in my replay, with m moving and linked children staying synchronized. A 100-case synthetic sweep also completed without failures. The Python-backed tests hit a read-only-environment issue in `dill`’s temporary-directory lookup; I’m retrying with that lookup set in memory, without changing files.

The boundary-focused sweep found a regression: valid LA fits can stall near changes in `ceil(3.5σ)`. A reproducible case starts at m = 2.6 and fails after 30 iterations; `main` converges on the same data. I’m checking the cause and narrowing the final finding. The committed U 4f cases still pass.

- **MAJOR — [templates/index.html:8311](/Users/skyefortier/xps-app/.claude/worktrees/fix-cam-continuous/templates/index.html:8311): enabling m optimization exposes kernel-boundary stalls.** The central-difference Jacobian can cross a `ceil(3.5σ)` transition, producing a misleading derivative and exhausting damping.

  Reproduced with 61 points `x[i] = 280 + 0.05*i`, zero background, and LA truth: center `281.538`, FWHM `0.8`, amplitude `5000`, α `1.2`, β `1.5`, m `18/7 − 0.001`. Add `0.1*sin(3*i)` to the data. Start at amplitude `4000`, m `2.6`, other parameters at truth, all unlocked. **HEAD fails after 30 iterations; main converges after four.**

  At failure, m is `2.571201718`; its Jacobian interval crosses the kernel transition at `18/7`. Changing only `H_REL` to `1e-5` in memory restores convergence in five iterations, supporting the diagnosis. The local derivative/step handling needs to accommodate these transitions while preserving the server mirror, with this case added as a regression test.

Validation: all nine committed U 4f targets converge and synchronize linked m values. The 108-component measurement reproduces the documented maximum errors. The three numerical test files pass **121 tests, with two intentional TODOs**, after an in-memory workaround for Python’s temporary-directory lookup in the read-only environment. The new recovery test misses the boundary failure above.

No files changed.

**VERDICT: NO-GO**
