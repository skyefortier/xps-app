# DS+G page evaluator — a grid-aware mirror of the server's convolution (2026-09-22)

Branch `fix-dsg-page-evaluator` off main `b3c9e37` (A03 deployed). Owner's
brief: "Port the server's convolution to a grid-aware page evaluator.
Acceptance: the existing todo tests (parity sweep DS+G box at 1e-6, the
round-trip case), PLUS convergence demonstrated across the full β/m range the
optimiser can reach — including the corners that produced 1e52, not only the
Find Peaks box. Nothing de-listed, nothing changed in Find Peaks." Interim
red notice skipped unless a third Codex round or more than a day.

## 1. The defect (A03 sweep, section (D))

The page drew, integrated and exported a DS+G component with `laCasaXPS`, a
numerical quadrature whose step resolved the Lorentzian core (β/3) but not
the Gaussian kernel (σ = m/2.355). At β = 2, m = 0.05 the step was 0.67 eV
against σ = 0.021 eV and the curve was 1e52 × amplitude; across the fitted
box the page's area was 23–64 % of the server's. On the exact box Find Peaks
emits for a graphitic C 1s line (`autofit/regions/c1s.py`: β fixed at 0.05,
α 0–0.3, m in the graphitic FWHM range 0.4–1.2, polymers 0.8–1.8) the page's
curve was off by up to 13.7 % of amplitude and its area 5–21 % low for
α 0.15–0.3 (α = 0 was fine). Every A- and M-family candidate is built on
that slot, so an applied suggestion was drawn and quantified wrong; the
manual dropdown was the same path. 0 of the 530 committed peak records use
DS+G.

## 2. The fix

`dsgConvolved_array(beArr, center, alpha, beta, m)` in `templates/index.html`
is a literal mirror of `fitting._ds_g_dscore_gauss` for m ≥ 0.001 (the
m < 0.001 delta branch, `dsgDeltaKernel_array`, was already mirrored):

- α clipped to [0, 0.495], β ≥ 1e-6, m ≥ 0 — as the server;
- step = median |Δx| (numpy's median), ≥ 1e-6;
- padded grid ±max(10 m, 20 β) at that step, `np.linspace` semantics
  (always ascending, endpoint set exactly);
- DS core on the padded grid, non-finite → 0; half-cosine tapers over each
  pad (`np.linspace(0, π, n_pad)`);
- Gaussian kernel of σ = m/(2√(2 ln 2)) on the same step, centred at
  (n − 1)/2, normalised to unit sum over the FULL padded length;
- the server's circular convolution `irfft(rfft(ds)·rfft(ifftshift(k)))`
  evaluated DIRECTLY: out[i] = Σⱼ ds[j]·k[(i − j + ⌊n/2⌋) mod n], the sum
  restricted to |i − j| ≤ ⌈8σ/step⌉ + 1 (the kernel is e⁻³² ≈ 1e-14 of its
  peak beyond 8σ; the circular wrap reaches no other kernel mass);
- `np.interp` back to the data grid; normalised by the value interpolated AT
  the centre (fallbacks as the server's); non-finite → 0.

`evalPeakArray` routes every DS+G through it (the delta branch inside). The
scalar `evalPeak` DSG_LA branch keeps the name `laCasaXPS` but is now the
normalised DS core with m ignored — the same status as its LACX branch;
guard (C) of the parity harness proves no shipped caller reaches it. The
old quadrature is deleted, not tuned.

Cost: 0.3–1.1 ms per evaluation on a 241-point grid for Find Peaks-like
parameters, 5.5 ms at the box's far corner (β 2, m 4); a local fit of a
DS+G component converges in 69 ms.

## 3. Acceptance (measured)

| check | result |
|---|---|
| parity sweep (D), DS+G box α {0, 0.25, 0.49} × β {0.05, 0.7, 2} × m {0.001, 0.05, 0.4, 2, 4}, base grid | ≤ 3e-15 of amplitude (was 1e52 at β 2, m 0.05) — now a hard assertion |
| (D′) the same box on: 0.1 eV step; 0.02 eV step; descending grid; centre half a step off-grid; descending + 0.03 eV off-grid; a 30-point window narrower than the pad; a 0.0503 eV step | < 1e-6 on every combination — hard assertions |
| (A) DS+G at the base peak (was todo) | hard, passes |
| round trip page → server → page, DS+G (was todo), and DS+G m locked at 0.05 and at 4 (curve comparison was disabled) | hard, pass |
| (B) scalar vs array evaluator, DS+G | now `todo` like LACX: the convolution is a grid operation; guard (C) holds |
| Find Peaks box (β 0.05, α 0–0.3, m 0.4–1.8, 0.05 and 0.1 eV grids) | agrees with the server to 1e-6 (was 5–21 % low in area) |

Nothing changed on the server, in `autofit/`, in Find Peaks or in the
dropdown. Python suite untouched by this unit (no Python change); JS suite
and browser check in §5.

## 4. Sites

`laCasaXPS` (rewritten), `dsgConvolved_array` (new), `evalPeakArray`;
every function-extractor list that names the lineshape block
(`tests/js/lineshape_roundtrip.test.js`, `local_lm_descent.test.js`,
`scripts/local_server_gap.js`, `scripts/voigt_saved_vs_refit.js`) now lists
`dsgConvolved_array`; `tests/js/lineshape_parity.test.js` (A), (B), (D),
(D′); `tests/js/lineshape_roundtrip.test.js`; CLAUDE.md; findings §7.

## 5. Verification

- JS suite: 382 tests, 377 pass, 0 fail, 5 todo (`node --test tests/js/*.test.js`).
  The five: LACX m > 0 in (A), (B) and (D); (B) DS+G (scalar evaluator
  ignores m, by design); the LACX round trip.
- Python suite: untouched by this unit (no Python change); the A03 run on
  the same server code was 989 passed / 7 skipped.
- Browser check (`browser_check_dsg.py`, dev gunicorn :5151 with the
  production `--timeout 300`): the committed UCl4-graphite C1s Scan with its
  Graphite line switched to DS+G at Find Peaks' parameters (β 0.05, α 0.2,
  m 0.8), Run Fit (fitted α 0, β 0.053, m 0.62): the curve the page draws
  for it equals the server's fitted curve to 1.2e-12 of amplitude (the five
  GL lines 1e-13); its Results area equals the server curve's to 0.0000 %;
  the chart dataset is the drawn curve; a `ds_g` Find Peaks candidate maps
  to DSG_LA with its α, β, m; no page errors.

## 5a. Finding on the way: a DS+G Run Fit costs the server ~110 s

Not this unit's change (fitting.py is untouched) and present on main
today. On the committed UCl4-graphite C1s Scan (191 points, 0.1 eV) with
the Graphite line switched to DS+G at Find Peaks' parameters (β 0.05,
α 0.2, m 0.8) and five GL lines: the plain fit takes 0.4 s (640 DS+G
evaluations, 0.3 ms each), but each of the page's `n_perturb: 3` restarts
takes ~18 s (28,821 evaluations — the perturbed descent runs to the
optimiser's evaluation budget), and with `n_starts: 3` the request takes
110 s. Production's gunicorn `--timeout 300` covers it; a dev server on the
30 s default returns a worker timeout and the page reports "Fit failed".
Every A- and M-family Find Peaks candidate applied and re-fitted pays this.
Logged for its own look (why the perturbed DS+G descent does not converge;
whether the restarts should be skipped or capped for this shape).
