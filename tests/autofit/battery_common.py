roster guard, eval parity vs saved fittedY, seeded-refit stability vs the

#   'smart' backgrounds that perturbs the recomputed background by
#   O(100 counts) mid-window (measured U 4f: eval relmax ~7e-3 with the
#   deviation profile exactly matching the background, not the shapes).
# - fixture_rtol: bounded below by CROSS-PROCESS FP wobble in the LACX
#   convolution path (~6e-6 relative on fitted params; exactly 0.0 within
#   one process).  Simple shapes (C 1s) reproduce at 1e-6.
