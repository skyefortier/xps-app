Shared characterization-battery harness (used by the per-region
test_*_parity_battery.py files).

Three layers per region (see test_c1s_parity_battery.py for the rationale):
roster guard, eval parity vs saved fittedY, seeded-refit stability vs the
expert fit + frozen fixture records.

#   fields move with post-fit charge-correction nudges and round to 0.1 eV,
#   so the nearest-index anchors can shift ±1 grid point vs fit time; for
#   'smart' backgrounds that perturbs the recomputed background by
#   O(100 counts) mid-window (measured U 4f: eval relmax ~7e-3 with the
#   deviation profile exactly matching the background, not the shapes).
# - fixture_rtol: bounded below by CROSS-PROCESS FP wobble in the LACX
#   convolution path (~6e-6 relative on fitted params; exactly 0.0 within
#   one process).  Simple shapes (C 1s) reproduce at 1e-6.
